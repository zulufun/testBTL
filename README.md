# Secure Digital Transformation: AI-Driven Cybersecurity Solution

## Overview

As digital threats continue to evolve, businesses need more advanced tools to secure their digital assets. Our **AI-driven Cybersecurity Solution** provides an intelligent, automated approach to detecting and responding to cyber threats in real-time. By integrating **AI models** with a **Flask**-based backend and a **Tailwind CSS** frontend, this platform helps organizations stay ahead of sophisticated cyberattacks and ensures that they can take immediate action when threats are detected.

## Key Features

### 1. **AI-Driven Cyber Threat Detection**
   - **Real-time threat analysis** based on network logs, system logs, and other data sources.
   - **AI Model**: Predicts the likelihood of various types of cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and insider attacks.
   - **Output**: A threat-level score, threat categorization (e.g., phishing, malware), and suggested mitigation actions.

### 2. **Threat Overview Dashboard**
   - Real-time visualization of detected threats.
   - Displays metrics such as threat count, type distribution, severity levels, and affected systems.
   - Color-coded alerts and interactive graphs.

### 3. **Geo-Location Map**
   - Map visualization of IP addresses linked to potential threats using **Leaflet.js** or **Mapbox**.
   
### 4. **Log Analysis Panel**
   - Display raw or filtered logs in a searchable, sortable table.
   - Filters for IPs, timestamps, users, severity levels.

### 5. **Threat Timeline**
   - Visualizes threats over time (e.g., hourly, daily trends).
   - Interactive charting using **Chart.js** or **D3.js**.

### 6. **Anomaly Detection Insights**
   - Displays unusual user behavior or network activity (e.g., data transfer spikes, failed login attempts).

### 7. **Real-Time Updates**
   - Dashboard updates in real-time using WebSockets or polling.

### 8. **User Action Panel**
   - Allows users to take actions on threats, e.g., blocking IPs or notifying an admin.
   - **Modal popups** for confirmation.

### 9. **Prediction Accuracy Metrics**
   - Displays model performance metrics (Precision, Recall, F1 Score, AUC-ROC).

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js, Leaflet.js / Mapbox
- **Backend**: Flask, MongoDB, WebSockets / Polling
- **AI/ML**: Scikit-learn, Joblib, Pandas
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login, JWT, hcaptcha
- **Data**: NSL-KDD, CIC-IDS-2017 (network intrusion dataset)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python** (3.7 or higher)
- **Node.js** (14.x or higher)
- **MongoDB** (Local or Cloud instance)

### Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/secure-digital-transformation.git
cd secure-digital-transformation
```

### Backend (Flask)

1. Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set up your **MongoDB** instance. You can either use a local MongoDB setup or connect to a cloud instance (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).
3. Run the Flask app:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The backend will run at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend (React + Tailwind CSS)

1. Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. Build the React app:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Connect Backend and Frontend

- Make sure that your frontend can communicate with the Flask backend. In `frontend/package.json`, ensure that the proxy points to the backend:

   ```json
   "proxy": "http://localhost:5000"
   ```

## Usage

### Dashboard Overview

- The **Threat Overview Dashboard** will give you insights into detected threats, metrics on threat types, severity, and affected systems.
- Use the **Log Analysis Panel** to filter and search through system logs.
- The **Geo-Location Map** will show you the geographic locations of threats.
- The **Prediction Accuracy Metrics** will help you track the AI model’s performance.

### Action on Threats

- From the **User Action Panel**, you can take actions such as blocking malicious IPs or notifying admins.
- **Alert System** will notify you of critical threats in real-time.

### Real-Time Updates

- The dashboard is designed to update in real-time using WebSockets or polling, so you’ll always have the latest data.

## AI Model and Predictions

- The backend features an AI-driven prediction system that analyzes incoming data (e.g., network traffic, login attempts) and predicts whether a threat is likely.
- The model returns:
  - Threat level score (low, medium, high).
  - Categorization of threat types.
  - Suggested mitigation actions (e.g., block IP, isolate device).

## Future Improvements

- **Threat Correlation**: Link related threats to visualize attack patterns.
- **AI Feedback Loop**: Allow admins to provide feedback to improve the accuracy of the AI model.
- **Multi-Tenancy Support**: Enable dashboards for different teams with tailored views.
- **Threat Simulation**: Implement a test environment to simulate attacks and verify system detection.
